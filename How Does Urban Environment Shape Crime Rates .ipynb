    "Environmental factors strongly shape urban crime. Governments at all levels treat crime prevention as a key policy goal.  Although environmental ecology has become an important area in crime prevention and urban planning research(Lai et al., 2025), scholars still disagree about the specific ways built environment features influence crime(He and Li, 2022). Existing studies show that factors like the permeability of built environments, the mix of land uses, and road connectivity interact in complex ways with community collective efficacy and crime risk(Anderson et al., 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "This study aims to use spatial data from London to test the relationship between built environment features and crime rates. We will control for social and demographic factors and apply nonlinear modeling methods. We will explore how different features of the built environment affect property and non-property crimes, and how these effects vary across space.\n"

    "### 1.2 Literature review\n",
    "Many studies have explored how the built environment affects crime, but there is no clear answer. For example, residential areas often have lower crime than commercial or mixed-use zones. In addition, crime tends to fall after commercial spaces are turned into housing（Anderson et al., 2013）.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Urbanism promotes compact, walkable, and mixed-use areas to support sustainable cities. But some criminologists question its safety. Some studies show mixed results on how the built environment affects property crime. Also, they often overlook the effects of nearby social disadvantage.(He and Li, 2022). In addition, Butts and others pointed out that there is a \"nonlinear relationship\" between population density and crime(Butts et al., 2012). This shows that it is important to consider nonlinear effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most current studies use linear methods and do not fully capture the possible nonlinear relationships between environmental factors and crime rates. Given the complex causes of crime, it is necessary to explore nonlinear effects as a complement. Also, existing research mainly focuses on property and violent crimes, while giving less attention to crimes like disorder and drug offenses(He and Li, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "(Groff and Lockwood, 2014) pointed out that property crimes are most common on street segments, but disorder crimes are much less frequent.Therefore, this study will look at both property and non-property crimes. It will use changes in crime rates as the main outcome variable. The goal is to better show how built environment features influence urban crime patterns.\n",

    "\n",
    "This leads to the following research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ1** | Do crime rates vary spatially across London? Are the patterns of property crime and non-property crime distributed in the same way?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ2** | If spatial differences exist, are they correlated with built environment features such as greenspace, road density, and transport accessibility?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ3** | If such relationships hold, can we identify whether built environment changes—like housing growth—have a measurable temporal effect on crime?"

    "\n",
    "This study shows that crime in London varies widely across space and is closely tied to features of the built environment. Building density is the most consistent factor linked to crime, while short-term housing growth has little clear effect over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crime is not just a social issue—it is also shaped by space. Features like density, land-use mix, and how people move through the city affect where crime happens. Planners should focus less on how many homes are built each year and more on how city spaces are designed. Thinking about crime prevention in urban design could help build safer, more sustainable cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "•\t**Transport effects are mixed**\n",
    "Station closures often come with other changes, so their impact on crime is hard to separate.(Phillips and Sandler, 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t**Underreporting of crime**\n",
    "Not all crimes are reported, so actual levels may be higher than the data shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t**Limited spatial detail**\n",
    "Borough-level data may miss neighborhood-level patterns."
